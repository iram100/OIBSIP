TASK 2
Number Guessing Game
Objective:
To create a simple and fun Java console-based game that lets the user guess a randomly generated number by the computer. The game continues until the correct number is guessed or the number of attempts runs out. It helps users understand basic control flow, loops, conditionals, and user interaction.

Steps Performed:
A random number between 1 and 100 is generated using Java's Random class.
The user is asked to guess the number through the console input using Scanner.
The program checks if the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
Limited number of attempts are allowed (e.g., 10 tries per round).
Multiple rounds are played (e.g., 3 rounds total).
The number of attempts is counted and score is displayed accordingly.
Points or praise are given based on how quickly the number was guessed.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Language: Java
IDE: Any text editor or IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse
Java Classes: Scanner, Random

Concepts: Loops, Conditionals, User Input, Random Number Generation

Outcome:
Successfully built a fully functional number guessing game with multiple rounds.
The user is able to interact smoothly, get feedback on guesses, and see their score.
Strengthened understanding of loops, conditions, input/output, and basic Java structure.Number Guessing Game



TASK 3
ATM Interface

Objective:
To simulate a basic ATM interface using Java where users can log in and perform common banking operations such as withdrawal, deposit, checking transaction history, transfer, and quitting the session. This helps build knowledge of object-oriented programming (OOP) and Java class structure.

Steps Performed:
The user logs in with a User ID and PIN.
Once authenticated, a menu is displayed with 5 options:
Transaction History: Shows all previous actions (deposit, withdraw, transfer).
Withdraw: Deducts money if sufficient balance is available.
Deposit: Adds money to the balance.
Transfer: Simulates sending money to another user (via a dummy recipient).
Quit: Ends the session.
Data is stored in an object-oriented manner using separate classes:
ATMInterface – handles the main menu.
User – holds user data like ID, PIN, balance, and transaction history.
Transaction – (optional) for transaction details.
Main – runs the program.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Language: Java
IDE: IntelliJ / Eclipse / Online Java Compiler
Java Classes: Scanner, Custom classes (User, ATMInterface)

Concepts: OOP, Constructors, Loops, Conditional Statements, ArrayList

Outcome:
Successfully created an interactive and menu-driven ATM simulator.
Implemented five major banking functionalities using real-world logic.
Strengthened OOP skills in Java by dividing the project into multiple reusable classes.
User-friendly and practical console experience resembling real ATM usage
